          <p>
            Isaac Timothy is a singer-songwriter redefining what it means to be a modern Sri Lankan artist. With his powerhouse vocals,
            commanding stage presence, and fearless fusion of rock, pop, and Sri Lankan sounds, Isaac has proven he’s more than just a
            competition success story, he’s a rising star shaping his own lane in the industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            After capturing hearts on <strong>The Voice Sri Lanka Season 3 2025</strong> under the guidance of <strong>Coach Raini Charuka</strong>, Isaac’s journey has
            been unstoppable. He reached the finals of the show, winning audiences over with his passionate performances and emotional
            storytelling. His ability to balance raw power with genuine vulnerability has made him stand out as an artist who can both move and
            electrify a crowd.

            produced by Dilru Costa (Cozzy) and written by Yashodha Adhikari. The song blends his signature rock-pop edge with the richness
            of Sri Lankan music, marking a bold new direction for him. Following that, he’s set to make more English and Sinhala drops, before
            unveiling his <strong>first album</strong> next year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Off-stage, Isaac is grounded and introspective, a thoughtful creator who values connection as much as performance. On-stage, he’s
